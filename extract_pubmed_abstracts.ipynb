Finding the information you’re looking for can get a bit tedious when you have to manually click through each page of search results.\n",

    "Using the NCBI E-Utilities (Entrez Programming Utilities, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25499/), you can retrieve and download abstracts associated with a PubMed search without having to sift through the user interface. Even better, this tool doesn’t require any software–its completely URL based. You craft \"search\" and \"fetch\" commands as URLs and open them in your browser window to access the abstracts.\n",

    "We can automate the download process by programming a script in Python to construct the URLs, execute the \"search\" and \"fetch\" commands, and parse each part of the abstract (Authors, Journal, Date of publication, etc.) into a data file for downstream analysis. Text from each abstract can be analyzed to quickly extract numerical data or quantitative results.\n",

However, its molecular mechanism is largely unknown. To help\\nelucidate the potential mechanism of HNSCC tumorigenesis, we investigated the\\ngene interaction patterns associated with tumorigenesis.\\nMethods: Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) can help us to\\npredict the intrinsic relationship or correlation between gene expression.\\nAdditionally, we further explored the combination of clinical information and\\nmodule construction.\\nResults: Sixteen modules were constructed, among which the key module most\\nclosely associated with clinical information was identified. By analyzing the\\ngenes in this module, we found that the latter may be related to the immune\\nresponse, inflammatory response and formation of the tumor microenvironment.\\nSixteen hub genes were identified-ARHGAP9, SASH3, CORO1A, ITGAL, PPP1R16B,\\nTBC1D10C, IL10RA, ITK, AKNA, PRKCB, TRAF3IP3, GIMAP4, CCR7, P2RY8, GIMAP7, and\\nSP140. We further validated these genes at the transcriptional and translation\\nlevels.\\nConclusion: The innovative use of a weighted network to analyze HNSCC samples\\nprovides new insights into the molecular mechanism and prognosis of HNSCC.\\nAdditionally, the hub genes we identified can be used as biomarkers and\\ntherapeutic targets of HNSCC, laying the foundation for the accurate diagnosis\\nand treatment of HNSCC in clinical and research in the future.\\n\\nDOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S201177 \\nPMCID: PMC6689548\\nPMID: 31496804 \\n\\nConflict of interest statement: The authors report no conflicts of interest in\\nthis work.\""

       " 'B-cell responses are dynamic processes that depend on multiple types of\\ninteractions. Rare antigen-specific B cells must encounter antigen and\\nspecialized systems are needed-unique to each lymphoid tissue type-to ensure this\\nhappens efficiently. Lymphoid tissue barrier cells act to ensure that pathogens, \\nwhile being permitted entry for B-cell recognition, are blocked from replication \\nor dissemination. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells often need to be primed by\\ndendritic cells before supporting B-cell responses. For most responses,\\nantigen-specific helper T cells and B cells need to interact, first to initiate\\nclonal expansion and the plasmablast response, and later to support the germinal \\ncenter (GC) response. Newly formed plasma cells need to travel to supportive\\nniches. GC B cells must become confined to the follicle center, organize into\\ndark and light zones, and interact with Tfh cells. Memory B cells need to be\\npositioned for rapid responses following reinfection. Each of these events\\nrequires the actions of multiple G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their\\nligands, including chemokines and lipid mediators. This review will focus on the \\nguidance cue code underlying B-cell immunity, with an emphasis on findings from\\nour laboratory and on newer advances in related areas. We will discuss our recent\\nidentification of geranylgeranyl-glutathione as a ligand for P2RY8. Our goal is\\nto provide the reader with a focused knowledge about the GPCRs guiding B-cell\\nresponses and how they might be therapeutic targets, while also providing\\nexamples of how multiple types of GPCRs can cooperate or act iteratively to\\ncontrol cell behavior.',\n",
